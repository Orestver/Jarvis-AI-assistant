# Jarvis-AI-assistant
An assistant to help you manage your pc and perform boring tasks that you dont want to do.
JUST run the main file and then you can say whatever you want but first you need to say Jarvis to enter into the listening for command state.
And than you can give commands or just speaking with Jarvis

An AI model is used for communication, I do not bear any rights for what the artificial intelligence says
